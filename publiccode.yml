    genericName: collaborative spreadsheet
    longDescription: |
      Grist is a hybrid database/spreadsheet, meaning that:

      - Columns work like they do in databases: they are named, and they hold one kind of data.
      - Columns can be filled by formula, spreadsheet-style, with automatic updates when referenced cells change.


      This difference can confuse people coming directly from Excel or Google
      Sheets. Give it a chance! There's also a [Grist for Spreadsheet
      Users](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-for-spreadsheet-users/) article
      to help get you oriented. If you're coming from Airtable, you'll find the
      model familiar (and there's also our [Grist vs
      Airtable](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-v-airtable/) article for a
      direct comparison).

      Here are some specific feature highlights of Grist:

      - Python formulas.
          - Full [Python syntax is supported](https://support.getgrist.com/formulas/#python), including the standard library.
          - Many [Excel functions](https://support.getgrist.com/functions/) also available.
          - An [AI Assistant](https://www.getgrist.com/ai-formula-assistant/) specifically tuned for formula generation (using OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo or [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) via [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python)).
      - A portable, self-contained format.
          - Based on SQLite, the most widely deployed database engine.
          - Any tool that can read SQLite can read numeric and text data from a Grist file.
          - Enables [backups](https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document) that you can confidently restore in full.
          - Great for moving between different hosts.
      - Can be displayed on a static website with [`grist-static`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-static) â€“ no special server needed.
      - A self-contained desktop app for viewing and editing locally: [`grist-electron`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-electron).
      - Convenient editing and formatting features.
          - Choices and [choice lists](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#choice-list-columns), for adding colorful tags to records.
          - [References](https://support.getgrist.com/col-refs/#creating-a-new-reference-list-column) and reference lists, for cross-referencing records in other tables.
          - [Attachments](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns), to include media or document files in records.
          - Dates and times, toggles, and special numerics such as currency all have specialized editors and formatting options.
          - [Conditional Formatting](https://support.getgrist.com/conditional-formatting/), letting you control the style of cells with formulas to draw attention to important information.
      - Drag-and-drop dashboards.
          - [Charts](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-chart/), [card views](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-card/) and a [calendar widget](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-calendar/) for visualization.
          - [Summary tables](https://support.getgrist.com/summary-tables/) for summing and counting across groups.
          - [Widget linking](https://support.getgrist.com/linking-widgets/) streamlines filtering and editing data. Grist has a unique approach to visualization, where you can lay out and link distinct widgets to show together, without cramming mixed material into a table.
          - [Filter bar](https://support.getgrist.com/search-sort-filter/#filter-buttons) for quick slicing and dicing.
      - [Incremental imports](https://support.getgrist.com/imports/#updating-existing-records).
          - Import a CSV of the last three months activity from your bank...
          - ...and import new activity a month later without fuss or duplication.
      - Integrations.
          - A [REST API](https://support.getgrist.com/api/), [Zapier actions/triggers](https://support.getgrist.com/integrators/#integrations-via-zapier), and support from similar [integrators](https://support.getgrist.com/integrators/).
          - Import/export to Google drive, Excel format, CSV.
          - Link data with [custom widgets](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/#_top), hosted externally.
          - Configurable outgoing webhooks.
      - [Many templates](https://templates.getgrist.com/) to get you started, from investment research to organizing treasure hunts.
      - Access control options.
          - (You'll need SSO logins set up to make use of these options; [`grist-omnibus`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-omnibus) has a prepackaged solution if configuring this feels daunting)
          - Share [individual documents](https://support.getgrist.com/sharing/), workspaces, or [team sites](https://support.getgrist.com/team-sharing/).
          - Control access to [individual rows, columns, and tables](https://support.getgrist.com/access-rules/).
          - Control access based on cell values and user attributes.
      - Self-maintainable.
          - Useful for intranet operation and specific compliance requirements.
      - Sandboxing options for untrusted documents.
          - On Linux or with Docker, you can enable [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor) sandboxing at the individual document level.
          - On macOS, you can use native sandboxing.
          - On any OS, including Windows, you can use a wasm-based sandbox.
      - Translated to many languages.
      - `F1` key brings up some quick help. This used to go without saying, but in general Grist has good keyboard support.
