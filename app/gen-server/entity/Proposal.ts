/**
 *
 * A table for tracking proposed changes to documents.
 *
 * For a "githubby" feal, proposals are identified with a document and a
 * short incrementing integer that is unique for that document, like the PR
 * number associated with repositories.
 *
 * The "comparison" column contains changes in the format used by the
 * /compare endpoint. This could be tweaked in future. That format represents
 * an overall diff, but doesn't give details of individual steps.
 *
 * The "comparison" column shouldn't be allowed to get too big, ideally.
 * Any large changes should be externalized - either computed on demand,
 * or placed in an S3-like store.
 *
 * Each proposal has a source and destination document. They are assumed to
 * share a common ancestor. The source contains the proposed changes.
 * Users of the destination document will be offered those changes, and there
 * should be a way to merge them into the destination document.
 *
 * Currently, only a single proposal is permitted between a given
 * source/destination pair. This should perhaps be relaxed, to be
 * future proof, although the UI would be likely to still be
 * constrained in this way for now.
 *
 * The 'status' of the proposal is a bit simplistic for now. Here are some
 * states of proposals:
 *   - dismissed
 *   - retracted
 *   - applied
 * If this feature were to grow, probably status would need to be events
 * in a full timeline, but it doesn't make sense to invest in that now, and
 * some kind of summary state would be needed anyway.
 *
 * There's at least one security problem with proposals. The source
 * document id may be a "secret" if it was created by an anonymous
 * user, in the sense that anyone who knows the id could edit
 * it. Something to bear in mind. Some proposal endpoints do some
 * censoring but may not be the right way to go.
