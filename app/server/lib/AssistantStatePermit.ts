 * A {@link Permit} that contains assistant-related state.
 *
 * This is currently used by the `/api/assistant/start` endpoint, which
 * redirects to the signup page if the user is unauthenticated.
 * As part of this redirect, a signup state cookie is set which
 * includes the ID of a {@link AssistantStatePermit} containing the
 * prompt the user submitted to the `/api/assistant/start` endpoint. This
 * permit is later replaced with one containing the `docId` of a new
 * document created on the user's first visit after signup, as part of
 * welcoming the user. Finally, the permit is retrieved and cleared
 * when the document with matching `docId` is first opened with the
 * `assistantState` URL parameter set to the permit's ID.
 *
 * Unlike browser cookies, which can only store upwards of ~4 KB of data,
 * permits are able to store significantly larger amounts of data, hence
 * why they are used to store assistant state like LLM prompts.
 * Cookies are still used to track permits across signups, but we only
 * store the permit IDs in them.
