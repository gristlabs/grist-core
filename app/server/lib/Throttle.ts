/**
 *
 * Simple CPU throttling implementation.
 *
 * For this setup, a sandbox attempting to use 100% of cpu over an
 * extended period will end up throttled, in the steady-state, to
 * 10% of cpu.
 *
 * Very simple mechanism to begin with.  "ctime" is measured for the
 * sandbox, being the cumulative time charged to the user (directly or
 * indirectly) by the OS for that process.  If the average increase in
 * ctime over a time period is over 10% (targetRate) of that time period,
 * throttling kicks in, and the process will be paused/unpaused via
 * signals on a duty cycle.
 *
 * Left for future work: more careful shaping of CPU throttling, and
 * factoring in a team-site level credit system or similar.

  /**
   * Start monitoring the given process and throttle as needed.
   * If readPid is set, CPU usage will be read for that process.
   * If tracedPid is set, then that process will be sent a STOP signal
   * whenever the main process is sent a STOP, and then another STOP
   * signal will be sent again shortly after.
   *
   * The tracedPid wrinkle is to deal with gvisor on a ptrace platform.
   * From `man ptrace`:
   *
   * "While being traced, the tracee will stop each time a signal is
   * delivered, even if the signal is being ignored.  (An exception is
   * SIGKILL, which has its usual effect.)  The tracer will be
   * notified at its next call to waitpid(2) (or one of the related
   * "wait" system calls); that call will return a status value
   * containing information that indicates the cause of the stop in
   * the tracee.  While the tracee is stopped, the tracer can use
   * various ptrace requests to inspect and modify the tracee.  The
   * tracer then causes the tracee to continue, optionally ignoring
   * the delivered signal (or even delivering a different signal
   * instead)."
   *
   * So what sending a STOP to a process being traced by gvisor will
   * do is not obvious. In practice it appears to have no effect
   * (other than presumably giving gvisor a change to examine it).
   * So for gvisor, we send a STOP to the tracing process, and a STOP
   * to the tracee, and then a little later a STOP to the tracee again
   * (since there's no particular guarantee about order of signal
   * delivery). This isn't particularly elegant, but in tests, this
   * seems to do the job, while sending STOP to any one process does
   * not.
   *
   * Alternatively, gvisor runsc does have "pause" and "resume"
   * commands that could be looked into more.
