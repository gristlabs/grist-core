/**
 * TODO For now, this is just a placeholder for an actual ActionHistory implementation that should
 * replace today's ActionLog. It defines all the methods that are expected from it by Sharing.ts.
 *
 * In addition, it will need to support some methods to show action history to the user, which is
 * the main purpose of ActionLog today. And it will need to allow querying a subset of history (at
 * least by table or record).
 *
 * The main difference with today's ActionLog is that it needs to mark actions either with labels,
 * or more likely with Git-like branches, so that we can distinguish shared, local-sent, and
 * local-unsent actions. And it needs to work on LocalActionBundles, which include more
 * information than what ActionLog stores. On the other hand, it can probably store actions as
 * blobs, which can simplify the database storage.
