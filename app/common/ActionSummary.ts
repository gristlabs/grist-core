/**
 * An ActionSummary represents the overall effect of changes that took place
 * during a period of history.
 *   - Only net changes are represented.  Intermediate changes within the period are
 *     not represented.  Changes that are done and undone within the period are not
 *     represented.
 *   - Net addition, removal, and renaming of tables is represented.  The names
 *     of tables, for ActionSummary purposes are their tableIds, the database-safe
 *     version of their names.
 *   - Net addition, removal, and renaming of columns is represented.  As for tables,
 *     the names of columns for ActionSummary purposes are their colIds.
 *   - Net additions and removals of rows are partially represented.  The rowIds of added
 *     and removed rows are represented fully.  The *values* of cells in the rows that
 *     were added or removed are stored in some cases.  There is a threshold on the
 *     number of rows whose values will be cached for each DocAction scanned.
 *   - Net updates of rows are partially represented.  The rowIds of updated rows are
 *     represented fully, but the *values* of updated cells partially, as for additions/
 *     removals.
 *   - Cell value changes affecting _grist_* tables are always represented in full,
 *     even if they are bulk changes.
 *
 * The representation of table name changes and column name changes is the same,
 * simply a list of name pairs [before, after].  We represent the addition of a
 * a table (or column) as the special name pair [null, initialName], and the
 * removal of a table (or column) as the special name pair [finalName, null].
 *
 * An ActionSummary contains two fields:
 *   - tableRenames: a list of table name changes (including addition/removal).
 *   - tableDeltas: a dictionary of changes within a table.
 *
 * The key of the tableDeltas dictionary is the name of a table at the end of the
 * period of history covered by the ActionSummary.
 *   - For example, if we add a table called N, we use the key N for it.
 *   - If we rename a table from N1 to N2, we use the key N2 for it.
 *   - If we add a table called N1, then rename it to N2, we use the key N2 for it.
 * If the table was removed during that period, we use its name at the beginning
 * of the period, preceded by "-".
 *   - If we remove a table called N, we use the key -N for it.
 *   - If we add a table called N, then remove it, there is no net change to represent.
 *   - If we remove a table called N, then add a new table called N, we use the key -N
 *     for the first, and the key N for the second.
 *
 * The changes within a table are represented as a TableDelta, which has the following
 * fields:
 *   - columnRenames: a list of column name changes (including addition/removal).
 *   - columnDeltas: a dictionary of changes within a column.
 *   - updateRows, removeRows, addRows: lists of affected rows.
 *
 * The columnRenames/columnDeltas pair work just like tableRenames/tableDeltas, just
 * on the scope of columns within a table rather than tables within a document.
 *
 * The changes within a column are represented as a ColumnDelta, which is a dictionary
 * keyed by rowIds.  It contains CellDelta values.  CellDelta values represent before
 * and after values of a particular cell.
 *   - a CellDelta of [null, [value]] represents a cell that was non-existent coming into
 *     existence with the given value.
 *   - a CellDelta of [[value], null] represents an existing cell with the given value that
 *     is removed.
 *   - a CellDelta of [[value1], [value2]] represents a change in value of a cell between
 *     two known values.
 *   - a CellDelta of ['?', [value2]] represents a change in value of a cell from an
 *     unknown value to a known value.  Unknown values happen when we know a cell was
 *     implicated in a bulk change but its value didn't happen to be stored.
 *   - a CellDelta of [[value1], '?'] represents a change in value of a cell from an
 *     known value to an unknown value.
 * The CellDelta itself does not tell you whether the rowId has the same identity before
 * and after -- for example it may have been removed and then added.  That information
 * is available by consulting the removeRows and addRows fields.
