   *     a delayed effect.  It will schedule (or reschedule) the operation to occur
   *     after this interval.  If the operation is currently in progress, it will
   *     get rerun after it completes.
   *
   *   - minDelaybetweenOperationsMs: is set, scheduling for operations will have
   *     additional delays inserted as necessary to keep this minimal delay between
   *     the start of successive operations.
   *
   *   - retry: if `retry` is set, the operation will be retried
   *     indefinitely with a rather primitive retry mechanism -
   *     otherwise no attempt is made to retry failures.
   *
   *   - logError: called when errors occur, with a count of number of failures so
   *     far.
   *   - scheduleFromFirstAdd: if set, a call to addOperation won't
   *     reschedule work that hasn't started yet. Set this if you
   *     want the operation to start at a fixed delay from the
   *     first time it is added, rather than the last. Otherwise,
   *     by default, adding will reset the delay.
