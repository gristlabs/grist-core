"""
This module is used in the implementation of ordering of records in Grist. Order is maintained
using floating-point "positions". E.g. inserting a record will normally add a record with position
being the average of its neighbor's positions.

The difficulty is that it's possible (and sometimes easy) to get floats closer and closer
together, until they are too close (and average of neighbors is equal to one of them). This
requires adjusting existing positions.

This problem is known in computer science as the List-Labeling Problem. There are known algorithms
which maintain ordered labels using fixed number of bits. We use an approach that requires
amortized log(N) relabelings per insert.

For references:
  [Wikipedia] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-maintenance_problem
    The Wikipedia article describes in particular an approach using Scapegoat Trees.
  [Bender] http://erikdemaine.org/papers/DietzSleator_ESA2002/paper.pdf
    This paper by Bender et al is the best I found that describes the theory and a reasonably
    simple solution that doesn't require explicit trees. This is what we rely on here.

What complicates our approach is that inserts never modify positions directly; instead, when we
have items to insert, we need to prepare adjustments (both to new and existing positions), which
are then turned into DocActions to be communicated and applied (both in memory and in storage).

The interface offered by this class is a single `prepare_inserts()` function, which takes a sorted
list and a list of keys, and returns the adjustments to existing records and to the new keys.

Note that we rely heavily here on availability of a sorted container, for which we use the
sortedcontainers module from here:
  http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/sortedlist.html
  https://github.com/grantjenks/sorted_containers

Note also that unlike the original paper we deal with floats rather than integers. This is to
maximize the number of usable bits, since other parts of the system (namely Javascript) don't
support 64-bits integers. We also avoid renumbering everything when we double the number of
elements. The changes aren't vetted theoretically, and may break some conclusions from the paper.

Throughout this file, "key" refers to the floating point value that's called a "label" in
list-labeling papers, "position" elsewhere in Grist code, and "key" in sortedcontainers docs.

    #   enclosing intervals around the key it wants to insert, doubling the interval each time,
    #   until it finds an interval that doesn't overflow. The overflow threshold is calculated in
    #   such a way that the bigger the interval, the smaller the density it seeks.
    # - The algorithm uses integers, picking the number of bits to work for list length between
    #   n/2 and 2n, and rebuilding from scratch any time length moves out of this range. We don't
    #   rebuild anything, don't change number of bits, and use floats. This breaks some of the
    #   theoretical results, and thinking about floats is much harder than about integers. So we
    #   are not on particularly solid ground with these changes (but it seems to work).
    # - We try different thresholds, which seems to perform better. This is mentioned in "Variable
    #   T" section of [Bender] paper, but our approach isn't quite the same. So it's also on shaky
    #   theoretical ground.
