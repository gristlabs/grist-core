# Grist

Grist is a modern relational spreadsheet. It combines the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the
robustness of a database to organize your data and make you more productive.

This repository, `grist-core`, is the heart of Grist, and has what you
need to run a powerful spreadsheet hosting server. If you wish to view and edit
spreadsheets stored locally, another option is to use the
[`grist-electron`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-electron) desktop app for Linux, Mac, and Windows. And to show Grist spreadsheets on a website
without any special back-end support, your options include
[`grist-static`](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-static),
a fully in-browser build of Grist.
The `grist-core` repository is the basis for all these options, and
for the hosted spreadsheet services offered by
[`Grist Labs`](https://getgrist.com), an NYC-based company ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ that is the main developer of Grist, and by
[`ANCT DonnÃ©es et Territoires`](https://donnees.incubateur.anct.gouv.fr/toolbox/grist),
a French government agency ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· whose developers have made many
contributions to the code-base.
The `grist-core`, `grist-electron`, and `grist-static` repositories
are all open-source (Apache License, Version 2.0).

## Features

Grist is a hybrid database/spreadsheet, meaning that:

  - Columns work like they do in databases. They are named, and hold one kind of data.
  - Columns can be filled by formula, spreadsheet-style, with automatic updates when referenced cells change.

This difference can confuse people coming directly from Excel or Google Sheets. Give it a chance!
If you are coming from Airtable, you'll find the model familiar though (and there's a
[Grist vs Airtable](https://www.getgrist.com/blog/grist-v-airtable/) article that might interest you).


Here are some specific feature highlights of Grist:

  * Python formulas.
    - Full [Python syntax is supported](https://support.getgrist.com/formulas/#python), and the standard library.
    - Many [Excel functions](https://support.getgrist.com/functions/) also available.
  * A portable, self-contained format.
    - Based on SQLite, the most widely deployed database engine.
    - Any tool that can read SQLite can read numeric and text data from a Grist file.
    - Great format for [backups](https://support.getgrist.com/exports/#backing-up-an-entire-document) that you can be confident you can restore in full.
    - Great format for moving between different hosts.
	- Can be displayed on a static website with [grist-static](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-static).
	- There's a self-contained desktop app available for viewing and editing: [grist-electron](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-electron).
  * Convenient editing and formatting features.
    - Choices and [choice lists](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#choice-list-columns), for adding colorful tags to records without fuss.
    - [References](https://support.getgrist.com/col-refs/#creating-a-new-reference-list-column) and reference lists, for cross-referencing records in other tables.
    - [Attachments](https://support.getgrist.com/col-types/#attachment-columns), to include media or document files in records.
    - Dates and times, toggles, and special numerics such as currency all have specialized editors and formatting options.
    - [Conditional Formatting](https://support.getgrist.com/conditional-formatting/), letting you control the style of cells with formulas, to draw attention to important information.
  * Great for dashboards, visualizations, and data entry.
    - [Charts](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-chart/) for visualization.
    - [Summary tables](https://support.getgrist.com/summary-tables/) for summing and counting across groups.
    - [Widget linking](https://support.getgrist.com/linking-widgets/) streamlines filtering and editing data.
    Grist has a unique approach to visualization, where you can lay out and link distinct widgets to show together,
    without cramming mixed material into a table.
    - The [Filter bar](https://support.getgrist.com/search-sort-filter/#filter-buttons) is great for quick slicing and dicing.
  * [Incremental imports](https://support.getgrist.com/imports/#updating-existing-records).
    - So you can import a CSV of the last three months activity from your bank...
    - ... and import new activity a month later without fuss or duplicates.
  * Integrations.
    - A [REST API](https://support.getgrist.com/api/), [Zapier actions/triggers](https://support.getgrist.com/integrators/#integrations-via-zapier), and support from similar [integrators](https://support.getgrist.com/integrators/).
    - Import/export to Google drive, Excel format, CSV.
    - Can link data with custom widgets hosted externally.
  * [Many templates](https://templates.getgrist.com/) to get you started, from investment research to organizing treasure hunts.
  * Access control options.
    - (You'll need SSO logins set up to make use of these options; [grist-omnibus](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-omnibus) has a prepackaged solution if configuring this feels daunting)
    - Share [individual documents](https://support.getgrist.com/sharing/), or workspaces, or [team sites](https://support.getgrist.com/team-sharing/).
    - Control access to [individual rows, columns, and tables](https://support.getgrist.com/access-rules/).
    - Control access based on cell values and user attributes.
  * Can be self-maintained.
    - Useful for intranet operation and specific compliance requirements.
  * Sandboxing options for untrusted documents.
    - On Linux or with docker, you can enable
      [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor) sandboxing at the individual
      document level.
    - On OSX, you can use native sandboxing.
	- On any OS, including Windows, you can use a wasm-based sandbox.
  * Translated to many languages.

If you are curious about where Grist is going heading,

question in [our forum](https://community.getgrist.com),
or browse [our extensive documentation](https://support.getgrist.com).


## Using Grist

If you just want a quick demo of Grist:

  * You can try Grist out at the hosted service run
    by Grist Labs at [docs.getgrist.com](https://docs.getgrist.com)
	(no registration needed).
  * Or you can see an experimental fully in-browser build of Grist
    at [gristlabs.github.io/grist-static](https://gristlabs.github.io/grist-static/).
  * Or you can download Grist as a desktop app from [github.com/gristlabs/grist-electron](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-electron).

To get `grist-core` running on your computer with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), do:

```sh
docker pull gristlabs/grist
docker run -p 8484:8484 -it gristlabs/grist
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8484` in your browser. You'll be able to create, edit, import,
and export documents. To preserve your work across docker runs, share a directory as `/persist`:

```sh
docker run -p 8484:8484 -v $PWD/persist:/persist -it gristlabs/grist
```

Get templates at [templates.getgrist.com](https://templates.getgrist.com) for payroll,
inventory management, invoicing, D&D encounter tracking, and a lot
more, or use any document you've created on
[docs.getgrist.com](https://docs.getgrist.com).

If you need to change the port Grist runs on, set a `PORT` variable, don't just change the
port mapping:

```
docker run --env PORT=9999 -p 9999:9999 -v $PWD/persist:/persist -it gristlabs/grist
```

To enable gVisor sandboxing, set `--env GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=gvisor`.
This should work with default docker settings, but may not work in all
environments.

You can find a lot more about configuring Grist, setting up authentication,
and running it on a public server in our
[Self-Managed Grist](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/) handbook.

## Building from source

To build Grist from source, follow these steps:

    yarn install
    yarn run build:prod
    yarn run install:python
    yarn start
    # Grist will be available at http://localhost:8484/

Grist formulas in documents will be run using Python executed directly on your
machine. You can configure sandboxing using a `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR`
environment variable.

 * On OSX, `export GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=macSandboxExec`
   uses the native `sandbox-exec` command for sandboxing.
 * On Linux with [gVisor's runsc](https://github.com/google/gvisor)
   installed, `export GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=gvisor` is an option.
 * On any OS including Windows, `export GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR=pyodide` is available.

These sandboxing methods have been written for our own use at Grist Labs and
may need tweaking to work in your own environment - pull requests
very welcome here!

## Logins

Like git, Grist has features to track document revision history. So for full operation,
Grist expects to know who the user modifying a document is. Until it does, it operates
in a limited anonymous mode. To get you going, the docker image is configured so that
when you click on the "sign in" button Grist will attribute your work to `you@example.com`.
Change this by setting `GRIST_DEFAULT_EMAIL`:

```
docker run --env GRIST_DEFAULT_EMAIL=my@email -p 8484:8484 -v $PWD/persist:/persist -it gristlabs/grist
```

You can change your name in `Profile Settings` in
the [User Menu](https://support.getgrist.com/glossary/#user-menu).

For multi-user operation, or if you wish to access Grist across the
public internet, you'll want to connect it to your own Single Sign-On service.
There are a lot of ways to do this, including [SAML and forward authentication](https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-set-up-authentication).
Grist has been tested with [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/),
and Google/Microsoft sign-ins via [Dex](https://dexidp.io/).

## Why free and open source software

This repository, [grist-core](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core), is maintained by Grist
Labs. Our flagship product available at [getgrist.com](https://www.getgrist.com) is built from the code you see
here, combined with business-specific software designed to scale it to many users, handle billing,
etc.

Grist Labs is an open-core company. We offer Grist hosting as a
service, with free and paid plans. We also develop and sell
features related to Grist using a proprietary license, targeted at the
needs of enterprises with large self-managed installations. We see
data portability and autonomy as a key value Grist can bring to our
users, and `grist-core` as an essential means to deliver that. We are
committed to maintaining and improving the `grist-core` codebase, and
to be thoughtful about how proprietary offerings impact data portability
and autonomy.

By opening its source code and offering an [OSI](https://opensource.org/)-approved free license,
Grist benefits its users:

- **Developer community.** The freedom to examine source code, make bug fixes, and develop
  new features is a big deal for a general-purpose spreadsheet-like product, where there is a
  very long tail of features vital to someone somewhere.
- **Increased trust.** Because anyone can examine the source code, &ldquo;security by obscurity&rdquo; is not
  an option. Vulnerabilities in the code can be found by others and reported before they cause
  damage.
- **Independence.** Grist is available to you regardless of the fortunes of the Grist Labs business,
  since it is open source and can be self-hosted. Using our hosted solution is convenient, but you
  are not locked in.
- **Price flexibility.** If you are low on funds but have time to invest, self-hosting is a great
  option to have. And DIY users may have the technical savvy and motivation to delve in and make improvements,
  which can benefit all users of Grist.
- **Extensibility.** For developers, having the source open makes it easier to build extensions (such as the
  experimental [Custom Widget](https://support.getgrist.com/widget-custom/)). You can more easily
  include Grist in your pipeline. And if a feature is missing, you can just take the source code and
  build on top of it.

GRIST_FORWARD_AUTH_LOGOUT_PATH | if GRIST_FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER is set, Grist will forward to this path when user logs out.

When using forward authentication, you may wish to also set the following variables:

  * GRIST_FORCE_LOGIN=true to disable anonymous access.
  * GRIST_IGNORE_SESSION=true to ignore any user identity information in a cookie.
    Only do this if you use forward authentication on all paths.
    You may not want to use forward authentication on all paths if it makes
    signing in required, and you are trying to permit anonymous access.

GRIST_FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER is similar to GRIST_PROXY_AUTH_HEADER, but enables
a login system (assuming you have some forward authentication set up).

GREP_TESTS              | pattern for selecting specific tests to run (e.g. `env GREP_TESTS=ActionLog yarn test`).

## Tests

Tests are run automatically as part of CI when a PR is opened. However, it can be helpful to run tests locally
before pushing your changes to GitHub. First, you'll want to make sure you've installed all dependencies:

```
yarn install
yarn install:python
```

Then, you can run the main test suite like so:

```
yarn test
```

Python tests may also be run locally. (Note: currently requires Python 3.9.)

```
yarn test:python
```

For running specific tests, you can specify a pattern with the `GREP_TESTS` variable:

```
env GREP_TESTS=ChoiceList yarn test
env GREP_TESTS=summary yarn test:python
```
